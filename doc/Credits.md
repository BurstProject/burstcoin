Numerous people have contributed to make this software what it is
today. The Nxt-developers before Burst was forked off from the Nxt
code base, the initial - yet anonymous - creator of burstcoin who did
carve out PoS and instantiate PoC and also many small contributors who
helped out with small fixes, typos, translations etc. In case we
forgot to mention someone, please do not hesitate to bring this to our
