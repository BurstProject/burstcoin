The world's first HDD-mined cryptocurrency using an energy efficient
and fair Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus algorithm.

This wallet version is developed and maintained by the PoC consortium (PoCC) and supports several database backends:
- MariaDB (recommended, but complex installation)
- Firebird (2nd best choice)
- H2 (for compatibility/migration purposes)


### Software Installation

#### Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)

Please take a look at http://package.cryptoguru.org/ where you can
find the burstcoincg package. This will take care of the MariaDB
installation for you.

#### Windows

###### MariaDb

In the conf directory, copy brs-default.properties into a new file named brs.properties.

Download and install MariaDB https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx

The MariaDb installation will ask to setup a password for the root user. 
Add this password to the brs.properties file created above in the following section:
```
brs.dbUrl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/burstwallet
brs.dbUsername=root
brs.dbPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

The MariaDB installation will also install HeidiSQL, a gui tool to administer MariaDb.
Use it to connect to the newly created mariaDb server and create a new DB called 'burstwallet'. 

###### Firebird (alternative to MariaDb)

If you are not familiar with MariaDB we recommend you to go for
Firebird, in which case the following data needs to be added to
`conf/brs.properties`

```
brs.dbUrl=jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded:burst.firebird.db
brs.dbUsername=sysdba
brs.dbPassword=
```
After that you can simply run `burst.cmd` and that should start your wallet.

You can get all additional commands available by running `burst.cmd help`

#### Unix-like systems

Please install Java 8 (JRE 1.8) manually and run it by using burst.sh
You can get further information calling `burst.sh help`

Please note: Firebird (embedded) needs some more work on macOS at the moment.
All other supported databases should work as expected.

A good HowTo for running the wallet on a mac can be found here
https://www.reddit.com/r/burstcoin/comments/7lrdc1/guide_to_getting_the_poc_wallet_running_on_a_mac/


##### Configure and Initialize MariaDB

The Debian and Ubuntu packages provide an automatic configuration of
your local mariadb server. If you can't use the packages, you have to
initialize your database with these statements:

```
echo "CREATE DATABASE burstwallet; 
      CREATE USER 'burstwallet'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON burstwallet.* TO 'burstwallet'@'localhost';" | mysql -uroot
mysql -uroot burstwallet < init-mysql.sql
```

##### Configure your Wallet

Now you need to add the following stuff to your conf/brs.properties:

```
brs.dbUrl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/burstwallet
brs.dbUsername=burstwallet
brs.dbPassword=yourpassword
```

## Credits

Numerous people have contributed to make this software what it is
today. The Nxt-developers before Burst was forked off from the Nxt
code base, the initial - yet anonymous - creator of burstcoin who did
carve out PoS and instantiate PoC and also many small contributors who
helped out with small fixes, typos, translations etc. In case we
forgot to mention someone, please do not hesitate to bring this to our
attention. Past contributions that have been removed from the code
base are not mentioned, however. In alphabetical order:

@4nt1g0
* helping with JOOQ migration

@ac0v
* initial replacement of the H2 wallet against mariaDB in the CG-lineage of the wallet
* introduction of FirebirdDB to the list of supported DB backends, bugfixing, debugging
* streamlining helper scripts (invocation, compilation)
* work on macOS port, testing and release management
* JOOQ migration

@BraindeadOne
* providing a DB abstraction layer to allow for multiple DB backends
* implementing a load/dump mechanism for faster sync (called Quicksync)
* added SQL metrics to the code to be able to spot DB performance problems
* CPU core limit patch, so the wallet can be assigned only part of your resources

@chrulri improved wallet behavior when running under https

@daWallet did many bugfixes and stabilization improvements

@dcct
* support for parallel blockchain downloads
* various bugfixes and lib updates

@de-luxe took care of the releases between 1.2.5 and 1.2.9

@fusecavator
* initial OpenCL code (GPU acceleration support)
* critical fixes to the wallet spam-attack vulnerability

@LithMage provided fixes and enhancements to the UI

@Quibus DownloadCache

@rico666
* moved the wallet from Nxt to BRS/Burst namespace
* improvements and fixes to the documentation - revival of javadoc references
