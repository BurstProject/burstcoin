The world's first HDD-mined cryptocurrency using an energy efficient
and fair Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus algorithm.

This wallet version is developed and maintained by the PoC consortium
(PoCC) and supports a multitude of database backends. The two builtin
backends are:
- MariaDB (recommended)
- H2 (embedded, easier install)

Other DB backends are supported by the Burstcoin DB manager:

### Software Installation

#### Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)

- fetch the newest release ZIP file

If running for the first time,

- install Java
- install MariaDB
- run ```burst.sh help```
- probably you want to do ```burst.sh import mariadb```


if upgrading your wallet config from 1.3.6cg

```
burst.sh upgrade
```
will take the old `nxt-default.properties`/`nxt.properties` files and
create `brs-default.properties.converted`/`brs.properties.converted`
files in the conf directory. This should give you a headstart with the
new option naming system.

#### Windows

###### MariaDb

In the conf directory, copy `brs-default.properties` into a new file named `brs.properties`.

Download and install MariaDB <https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx>

The MariaDb installation will ask to setup a password for the root user. 
Add this password to the `brs.properties` file created above in the following section:
```
DB.Url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/brs_master
DB.Username=root
DB.Password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

The MariaDB installation will also install HeidiSQL, a gui tool to administer MariaDb.
Use it to connect to the newly created mariaDb server and create a new DB called `burstwallet`. 

#### MacOS

Plase use beatsbears' comfortable script <https://github.com/beatsbears/macos_burst/>
to install and maintain the Burst wallet on your Mac.
An older howto at ecomineearth
<https://ecomine.earth/macoswalletinstallguide/> basically describes
the manual steps the script above does for you.

#### Other Unix-like systems

Please install Java 8 (JRE 1.8) manually and run the wallet by using `burst.sh`
You can get further information calling `burst.sh help`

A good HowTo for running the wallet on a mac can be found here
<https://www.reddit.com/r/burstcoin/comments/7lrdc1/guide_to_getting_the_poc_wallet_running_on_a_mac/>


##### Configure and Initialize MariaDB

The Debian and Ubuntu packages provide an automatic configuration of
your local mariadb server. If you can't use the packages, you have to
initialize your database with these statements:

```
echo "CREATE DATABASE brs_master; 
      CREATE USER 'brs_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON brs_master.* TO 'brs_user'@'localhost';" | mysql -uroot
mysql -uroot < init-mysql.sql
```

##### Configure your Wallet

Now you need to add the following stuff to your `conf/brs.properties`:

```
DB.Url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/brs_master
DB.Username=brs_user
DB.Password=yourpassword
```
