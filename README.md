The world's first HDD-mined cryptocurrency using an energy efficient
and fair Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus algorithm.

This wallet version is developed and maintained by the PoC consortium
(PoCC) and supports a multitude of database backends. The two builtin
backends are:
- MariaDB (recommended, but complex installation)
- H2 (for compatibility/migration purposes)

Other DB backends are supported by the Burstcoin DB manager:
https://github.com/PoC-Consortium/burstcoin-db-manager


### Software Installation

#### Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)

Please take a look at http://package.cryptoguru.org/ where you can
find the burstcoincg package. This will take care of the MariaDB
installation for you.

#### Windows

###### MariaDb

In the conf directory, copy brs-default.properties into a new file named brs.properties.

Download and install MariaDB https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx

The MariaDb installation will ask to setup a password for the root user. 
Add this password to the brs.properties file created above in the following section:
```
brs.dbUrl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/burstwallet
brs.dbUsername=root
brs.dbPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

The MariaDB installation will also install HeidiSQL, a gui tool to administer MariaDb.
Use it to connect to the newly created mariaDb server and create a new DB called 'burstwallet'. 

#### Unix-like systems

Please install Java 8 (JRE 1.8) manually and run it by using burst.sh
You can get further information calling `burst.sh help`

A good HowTo for running the wallet on a mac can be found here
https://www.reddit.com/r/burstcoin/comments/7lrdc1/guide_to_getting_the_poc_wallet_running_on_a_mac/


##### Configure and Initialize MariaDB

The Debian and Ubuntu packages provide an automatic configuration of
your local mariadb server. If you can't use the packages, you have to
initialize your database with these statements:

```
echo "CREATE DATABASE burstwallet; 
      CREATE USER 'brs_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON burstwallet.* TO 'brs_user'@'localhost';" | mysql -uroot
mysql -uroot burstwallet < init-mysql.sql
```

##### Configure your Wallet

Now you need to add the following stuff to your conf/brs.properties:

```
brs.dbUrl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/burstwallet
brs.dbUsername=brs_user
brs.dbPassword=yourpassword
```

```
2017-03-15 2.0.0
           BRS - Burst Reference Software:
           Burst namespace, some NXT legacy is in API data sent P2P
           streamlined configuration namespace, more logical and intuitive
           migrated to JOOQ, supports many  DB backends; only H2 and mariaDB
           in-code to prevent bloat, all others via DB-manager
           UPnP functionality to help with router configuration for public nodes
           removed lots of unused code, updated many UI libraries
           significant improvements in P2P handling: re-sync speed, fork-handling
           peer acquisition
           Squashed many bugs and vulnerabilities, using subresource integrity
           test coverage went from 0% to over 20%

2017-10-28 1.3.6cg
           multi-DB support: added Firebird, re-added H2; support for quick
           binary dump and load

2017-09-04 1.3.4cg
           improved database deployment; bugfix: utf8 encoding

2017-08-11 1.3.2cg
           1st official PoCC release: MariaDB backend based on 1.2.9
```

## Build

Burstcoin can be built from source using maven or - preferably - via
the provided `burst.sh compile` script within this repository.

## Tools

To get rid of scalability and performance problems we use JProfiler as our
prefered <a href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">Java
Profiler</a>.

## Credits

Numerous people have contributed to make this software what it is
today. The Nxt-developers before Burst was forked off from the Nxt
code base, the initial - yet anonymous - creator of burstcoin who did
carve out PoS and instantiate PoC and also many small contributors who
helped out with small fixes, typos, translations etc. In case we
forgot to mention someone, please do not hesitate to bring this to our
attention. Past contributions that have been removed from the code
base are not mentioned, however. In alphabetical order:

* work on macOS port, testing and release management
* JOOQ migration and many more things

@Brabantian
* introduction of JUnit and Code Coverage reporting
* lots of unit tests and refactoring work to make the code testable

@BraindeadOne
* providing a DB abstraction layer to allow for multiple DB backends
* implementing a load/dump mechanism for faster sync (called Quicksync)
* added SQL metrics to the code to be able to spot DB performance problems
* CPU core limit patch, so the wallet can be assigned only part of your resources
